# hello-world
first GitHub tutorial

Hi, my name is Mike and I'm a software architect.  Didn't have such a thing when I started - been in software development for 35 years now. :)  Been there and done that a lot over the years, but getting a little behind the times on front-end development.  Now trying to teach myself all the new-fangled stuff like Node.JS, Express.JS, Angular.JS, and this here GitHub thing. :D

Cheers!
